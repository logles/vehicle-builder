## Description

Your task is to update an existing TypeScript command-line application that builds and uses cars to have additional options for motorbikes and trucks. The application prompts the user to create a new vehicle or select an existing vehicle. After going through the creation process or the selection process, the user is able to perform certain actions with the selected vehicle. The user is returned to the actions menu after each action until they decide to exit the application.

### Ussage

Create a Vehicle

If you choose to create a vehicle, you will be prompted to select the type of vehicle (Car, Truck, or Motorbike).
Enter the required details (e.g., make, model, year, weight, etc.) as prompted.
For vehicles with wheels (e.g., Motorbike, Car, Truck), you will also need to provide wheel details (diameter and brand).

After creating or selecting a vehicle, you can perform various actions, such as:
Print details
Start the vehicle
Accelerate or decelerate
Turn or reverse
Tow (only for trucks)
Perform a wheelie (only for motorbikes)
